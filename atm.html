  <p>ATM is a User Experience project, its objectif to design and prototype a web application to purchase ATM tickets online. During the first phase, we worked on the Kiosk interface (metro stations), analysed it and tried to fix the user gaps and problems. In the second one we worked on the ATM WebApp by defining differents tasks:</p>

  <p class="sub-title"><strong>Research, Observations and Interviews.</strong></p> 
  
 <p> We found that the interface is not intuitive, mobilizes System 2, low Learnability and Usability, lots of scopes for errors and the Interface is not in accordance to userâ€™s mental models.</p>

  <p class="sub-title"><strong>Analysis ( Expert Reviews)</strong> </p>
  <p>We analyzed the flow and the application structure, with an eye on the proper use of the key functions. Then defined different personas, and we created an open card sorting.</p>

  <p class="sub-title"><strong>UX Design</strong> </p>
  <p>Started by 3 tasks: Buy an urban ticket, Lost Card,Recharge Card.Determined task flows and designed the wireframes.</p>
 
  <p class="sub-title"><strong>UI</strong> </p>
  <p>We studied how to improve the look and feel of the WebApp. Taking care oftext styles, icons, color use, and whatever can be considered a smart way to make the design sharp and relevant. And at the end we tested the Web App.</p>
