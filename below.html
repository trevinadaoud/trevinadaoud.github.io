  <p>BELOW is a non profit organization for the preservation of marine life. BELOW exposes the flaws in the way that we, as people, affect the health and safety of marine life. There exists, a gap in the general knowledge of how marine life can thrive if we make efforts to protect it.</p>

  <p>The name BELOW, while seeming quite literal, also alludes to the in-depth research that the organization does. There are three aspects of the association: the museum, the research, and fundraising. The museum and research departments are located at the BELOW headquarters in New Zealand while fundraising takes place across the continent in various locations. The museum is a way to educate the general public who may be interested in getting to know how man effects the environment in respect to marine life. The research department continues to work diligently to discover not only new species but to insure that we are interacting with our oceans and the aquatic wildlife in the safest, healthiest ways to the best of our ability. The fundraising department hosts events across the continent of Oceania in order to raise money for the association and for further research.</p>

  <p>The logotype is going to change from an execution to another, we have 12 different icons and colors (combination and contrast)</p>
