  <h4 class="description">The Egyptian Artisanal House</h4>
  <p class="explication">Bachelor Project in Lebanon</p>
  
  <section class="project-analysis">
  <p>
  It is a building located in Downtown in Beirut and built in the same style of houses in the village of Aswan (Egypt). It would have the same feeling as a house in Aswan from its exterior and would have its own particular style in the interior with colorful walls decorated with beautiful drawings.</p>

   <p>Inside, we would find a a modern home with a traditional sensibility. The products would be arranged in the places they would be found in a regular house. Abayas would be in the closet, curtains would be hung on window...etc.</p>

  <p>The artisanal house would be comprised of two floors:
  The first floor would consist of the products for sale.
  The second floor would be made up of workshops divided by glass partitions for the artisans to work in. This would encourage the clientsâ€º confidence in the craftsmen themselves, and would create a sense of value and appreciation for the process of work.<strong> The artisanal house would have its own pattern, and its own particular identity.</strong></p>
