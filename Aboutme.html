   <p>Egyptian living in Lebanon since 1999, I studied Creative Advertising and Digital/Webdesign in Acad√©mie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts. In 2016, I moved to Milan to attend the Dual masters program in Visual and Web design in SPD, Scuola Politecnica di Design.</p>

   <p> Interested in patterns, colors and oriental graphics, I worked on different projects that reflect mainly my love to my native country and my attachment to the origins. This can be clearly seen not only in the theme of the projects but also within the choice of colors, patterns, and the design in general. I always had an interest and passion for Arts and Design, and I like to communicate new ideas and concepts.</p>
